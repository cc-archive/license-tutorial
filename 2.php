<p>Creative Commons gives you an easy way to give away some of those exclusive rights. You might want people to share your work without asking for your permission first. Or you might want people to build upon your creative work. CC licenses give you an easy way to let people do these things legally.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<p class="nospace">To get a CC license, you need to make only two decisions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decide which freedoms you want to give others.</li>
  <li>Decide if and how you\'ll limit those freedoms.</li>
</ol>
